# iPhone Calculator Sample Code

This is a proof of concept calculator app that mimics the builtin
calculator app that comes with every iPhone.

Use this project for learning purposes.

## Powered by Fructivity

This is the first in a series of sample apps that I'm going to build to
showcase how iOS and Mac apps are built.

## Project Detail

This project was built using [arc](http://developer.apple.com/technologies/ios5/) which means you wont have to worry about memory management.

All the interesting code happens inside CalculatorViewController:

- In viewDidLoad we programmatically create the UI buttons and the text
  area at the top.
- when a button is pressed, we decide wherever we need to perform a
  calculation or append the number to the screen.
- We also support memory buttons like Apple does, which is always a nice
  addition.
